## Dataset / Platforms

- Solutions use **LeetCode tables** for all problems.  
- Pandas solutions are implemented in **Python 3.x** within a Jupyter Notebook environment.  
- SQL solutions are written for **LeetCode SQL editor**.  

## Instructions

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in any Python environment (Jupyter, Colab, VSCode, etc.).  
2. Run the cells sequentially to see all **SQL queries**, **Pandas implementations**, and results.  
3. Each problem section includes:  
    - SQL solution  
    - Pandas solution  
    - Notes about logic and edge cases handled  
4. Problems are organized in the same order as the Week 4 assignment list.
